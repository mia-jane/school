        <p>The wolf thought to himself: 'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful - she will be better
            to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.'

            So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said: 'See, Little Red
            Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do
            not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school,
            while everything else out here in the wood is merry.' Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she
            saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she
            thought: </p>
        <h6>'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I
            shall still get there in good time.'</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        <p> So she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied
            that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door. </p>
        <p>'Who is there?'</p>
        <p>'Little Red Riding Hood,' replied the wolf. 'She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.'
        </p>
        <p> 'Lift the latch,' called out the grandmother, 'I am too weak, and cannot get up.'</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
        <p> The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the
            grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in
            bed and drew the curtains.Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when
            she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the
            way to her.</p>
